# Restaurant App for Udacity FEND Nanodegree
---
This project for restaurant reviews.


## How the app work
1. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`.
2. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and enjoy :).
